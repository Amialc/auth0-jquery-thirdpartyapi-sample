# Auth0 + jQuery + Third Party API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, jQuery and a Third party API like Firebase or Amazon.

To see the example working, just go to http://auth0.github.io/auth0-jquery-thirdpartyapi-sample/

If you want to connect to an API that you're going to develop in any language, please check [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-jquery-api-sample).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve` 
3. run `serve` in the directory of this project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).
