# Auth0 + jQuery + Third Party API Seed

This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create an app that will use Auth0, jQuery and a Third party API like Firebase or Amazon.

To see the example working, just go to http://auth0.github.io/auth0-jquery-thirdpartyapi-sample/

If you want to connect to an API that you're going to develop in any language, please check [this other seed](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-jquery-api-sample).

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run `npm install -g serve` 
3. run `serve` in the directory of this project.

Go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app running :).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
